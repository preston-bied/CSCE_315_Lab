            <h2>Wordle Solver</h2>
            <p> In my free time, I created a program to solve the popular game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" class="link">Wordle</a>.
                One of the functions of the program is to find possible answers to a daily Wordle puzzle but I also included another functionality. I used my knowledge of
                data structures and algorithms to run every possible Wordle game and find the best possible starting word (which I found to be the word "Soare").
                You can access a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" class="link">github</a> repository for the project
                <a target="_blank" class="link">here</a>.

            <h2>Working Y86-64 Processor</h2>
            <p> As part of the <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/tamu/courses/CSCE/312/" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Organization</a> course at Texas A&M, I got
                the opportunity to construct a working processor using the
                <a href="http://siever.info/cs400/Y86.html#:~:text=Unlike%20the%20IA32%20architecture%20covered,is%2048%2Dbits%20long)." target="_blank" class="link">
                Y86-64 instruction set</a> in the program <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/" target="_blank" class="link">Logisim</a>. The processor is built entirely
                out of logic gates and every component of the processor was created by me. 
                You can access a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" class="link">github</a> repository for the project
                <a target="_blank" class="link">here</a> which includes three different codes (with their Y86-64 encodings) that can be executed by the processor, additional
                information about the design architecture of the processor, and the Logisim file for the processor itself.

            <h2>Compiler (Unfinished)</h2>
            <p> One of the next projects that I would like to complete would be a to construct a working compiler from scratch. After taking the
                <a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/hlee42/csce314/intro.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">Programming Languages</a> course at Texas A&M,
                I have some basic knowledge on how a compiler works and I think it would be a fun project to create my own. Because of this, in Fall 2022, I decided
                to take the <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/tamu/courses/CSCE/434/" target="_blank" class="link">Compiler Design</a> course at Texas A&M, and by the end
                of the semester, I will have created a working compiler for the Java language, as seen in the

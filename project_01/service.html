            <h2>TAMU Big Event</h2>
            <p> Every year I have participated in the Texas A&M <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Big Event</a> and I will continue to do
                so for as long as I am a student at A&M. The Big Event takes place every spring where tens of thousands of students at Texas A&M come together to complete
                various community service tasks in the Bryan Colelge Station area. In the past, I have done the Big Event with the student organizations I have been a part of,

            <h2>Road Cleanup</h2>
            <p> Through an adopt a road program, my fraternity, <a href="https://alphasig.org/" target="_blank" class="link">Alpha Sigma Phi</a>, had the opportunity to adopt
                our own road in College Station. At least four times a year we will all get together for a road cleanup event at our adopted road where we volunteer to pick
                up trash along the road.

            <h2>Toy Drive</h2>
            <p> During December 2021, my fraternity, <a href="https://alphasig.org/" target="_blank" class="link">Alpha Sigma Phi</a>, put together a toy drive in which we
                collected toys for children in need during the holiday season. By the end of our drive, we had collected hundreds of toys. We put together service events like
                this every semester and I will continue to be a part of them for as long as I am in the fraternity.

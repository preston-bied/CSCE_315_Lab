    <p class="passage">
        Computer science is something that has interested me long before college, with HTML and CSS being the first languages I learned back in middle school. I would later learn Python on my own and fell in love with the analytical, problem-solving nature of coding and the greater world of computer science. In high school I took every class offered related to computer science, fully preparing me to enter college as a computer science major. I took Computer Science I and II and then went on to take AP Computer Science (which I scored a 4 in), all focused on the Java programming language. I would also take a web design course and another course focused on the hardware architecture of a PC. In college, Iâ€™ve taken intro to computer science courses as well as Programming Languages, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Computer Organization. In addition to computer science, mathematics is something that has always interested me, and I have pursued a minor in math at Texas A&M. Because of my joint interest in computer science and math, topics such as data science and machine learning have greatly interested me. Taking data structures and algorithms not only furthered those interests, but allowed me to gain the knowledge to start working on some personal projects of my own. The field of AI is something that has interested me, but I have yet to fully explore the topic and learn more about it. Recently, the field of computational complexity, specifically regarding the P vs. NP problem, is something that I have done a great deal of personal research on. It is something that I would love to take a course on in the future to further my understanding of the topic. Another topic I would like to know more about is cryptography, and especially its underlying computer science and math principles. In the coming years I will get the opportunity to do research at Texas A&M and I look forward to it.
